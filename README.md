# Xamarin Pok√©mon Demo

This is a sample android mobile application using pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/) and Xamarin. 

## Requirments
Get a Xamarin application connecting to <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">Poke Api</a>

A working Angular version of this project is available <a href="https://github.com/tfa7/Angular-Pokemon" target="_blank">https://github.com/tfa7/Angular-Pokemon</a>

## Screenshots

Available in the screenshots folder

## Why Xamarin

1. fully mobile
2. supports Android, IOS and UWP
3. has a large community for support 
4. ideal for .net developers

## Run Locally

To run this project locally:
1. download the repo
2. build the project in visual studio 
3. run the application 

## Project Details

### Working
1. splash screen 
2. retrieving and displaying the list of Pokemons 
3. filtering the list of Pokemons by text search
4. clicking on a Pokemon displays the selected Pokemon
5. save or remove favourite Pokemons by using cache

### Not Working
1. Filter by type
2. Navigation
3. Caching and saving to SQLite

I did not have enough time to complete this project because the Angular project was completed first. The reason the Angular project was completed first is because I was sure I had enough time and experience to get all the functionality completed in Angular.

## Development Details

### Linking of Activities -> Presenter -> Layout
1. HomeActivity: splash screen titled "Pokemon Demo App" -> "Presenter/HomePresenter" -> "Resources/layout/HomeScreenLayout"
2. DisplayPokemonActivity: displays the grid list of Pokemons titled "Pokemon List" -> "Presenter/DisplayPokemonPresenter" -> "Resources/layout/ViewPokemonLayout" & "Resources/layout/GridViewLayout"
3. PokemonDetailsActivity: displays the Pokemon item titled "Pokemon Details" -> "Presenter/PokemonDetailsPresenter" -> "Resources/layout/PokemonDetailsLayout"

### Model and Service Folder
1. Entity: contains the main Pokemon model classes
2. Service: calls the Pokemon Api and deserialises the JSON data to the model classes

### Resources Folder
1. Contains a list of images for each Pokemon. A 'hack' was implemented for the 'Resources\drawable' folder to name the image "pokemon_XXX.png" where XXX maps the Pokemon name.

AndroidExtenstions->CustomImageAdapter is where the images are mapped. Ideally when an image is not found the image could be got using the method "GetImageBitmapFromUrl" and saved to the local folder using the "pokemon_XXX.png" format. Each time a new image is found it could be save.

### Utilities Folder
1. List of constants variables  

### SQLite 
The setup is there but the project is not using this at the moment

## Hindsight
Create a blank new template in Visual Studio using the latest Xamarin tools/packages to make sure the project works on all platforms.

## Template
Due to time constraints this project used <a href="https://github.com/mdcruz/pokedex" target="_blank">https://github.com/mdcruz/pokedex</a> as a template. I updated this project to use PokeApi v2, tailored the screens and data to match project requirements. 

## Testing
No tests were created for this project.
