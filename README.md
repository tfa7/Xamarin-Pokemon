## Project Details

This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a> version 8.0.0.

This project uses <a href="https://material.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular-Material</a> and <a href="https://github.com/angular/flex-layout#readme" target="_blank">Angular Flex Layout</a>

## Development Details

### This project consists of 3 main components (in the components folder) 
1. pokemon-header: contains the mat-toolbar used for filtering
2. pokemon-detail: displays the Pokemon cards
3. pokemon-detail-modal: displays the selected Pokemon

We could keep the header and detail on one page but adhering to separation of concerns and single responsibility principle, both were placed in separate components. This makes it easier to manage and test these components. The observer behavioral design pattern ensures the respective components are in sync by allowing components to subscribe to the 'PokemonFilterService'.

### The services folder contains the following
1. api: contains the api calls to Poke Api plus, a resolver service that caches the pokemon types from the api call
2. behaviour-services: used to keep track of the Pokemon filters, and to sync this data between the pokemon-header and pokemon-detail components
3. guards: currently only used for changing the page title but these are more commonly used for security


### The pipes folder contains the filters for 
1. search text 
2. types

Pipes allow code to be reused

### The data-models contains 
1. the models to match the api requests

### The styles folders contains 
Several scss pages that are imported in to the main "styles.scss" file
1. custom.scss: global css styling
2. loading-ball.scss: a nice UI/UX component, displaed when waiting for an api response
3. material-custom.scss: changes to angular materialbase styling. This is usefuly if one decides to upgrade the project.
4. var.scss: colour variables for the global core theme styling

## Testing
No tests were created for this project.
